# dank app

# to run

- checkout 
- npm install
- do necessary eas setup e.g. https://github.com/jonsamp/test-expo-dev-client-eas-update
- step 7. from above link:
```eas build --profile development --platform ios```
then
```expo start --dev-client```
if your phone is nearby and has the app open it will now listen to that server instead for reloads (r) and cmd+s

maybe some holes but that's the general idea
